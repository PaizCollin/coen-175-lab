# COEN 175L: Compilers Lab

### Author: Collin Paiz

### Institution: Santa Clara University

### Professor: Dr. Darren Atkinson

### Session: Winter 2023

## Overview

#### This repository includes each stage of the `Simple C` compiler that was built throughout the course of COEN 175: Compilers.

## Phase 1 - Lexical Analysis

#### Demonstrate an understanding of lexical analysis and structure by utilizing flex to generate a scanner for the Simple C language.

## Phase 2 - Syntax Analysis

#### Demonstrate an understanding of syntax analysis and structure by implementing a recursive-descent parser for the Simple C language.

## Phase 3 - Symbol Table Construction

#### Demonstrate an understanding of semantic checking and rules by augmenting the parser to construct a symbol table for the Simple C language.

## Phase 4 - Type Checking

#### Demonstrate an understanding of type checking by augmenting the parser to perform type checking for the Simple C language.

## Phase 5 - Storage Allocation

#### Demonstrate an understanding of storage allocation, registers, and the stack frame by augmenting the parser to perform storage allocation for the Simple C language.

## Phase 6 - Code Generation

#### Demonstrate an understanding of code generation by extending the compiler to generate code for a 64-bit Intel processor running the Linux operating system for the Simple C language.
